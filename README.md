## üéì My process

### Personal Learning Goals

The goal for me with this project was learning about responsiveness and accessibility. In the previous projects I used a lot of fixed dimensions to make it look like toe design as much as possible. For this one I tried using none, but I still had to use it a couple of times. However, I tried to reduce that as much as possible.

I also made the mobile-version first.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM Naming Convention
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("üéâ");
};
```
